/*
  Compiler vs interpreter they both aapke code ki errors ko check krte hai & error aane pe code ko chala dete hai.

 ? Complier => Poore code compile krta hai & last mein error de deta hai ek sath agar hota hai to.
  ("It compiles the entire code and at the end, if there are any errors, it shows them all together.")
